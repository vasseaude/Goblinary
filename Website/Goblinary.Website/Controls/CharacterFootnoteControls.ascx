<p class="characterFootnote" runat="server" id="CharacterFootnote"><small><b>Notice:</b> Your character data is considered private and confidential, and the designers/owners of this website
	will always respect this. We will never share your character information, including "builds", with anyone outside of this
	development team (currently consisting exclusively of <i>Kitsune</i> and <i>Nihimon</i>). We don't even want to <i>accidentally</i>
	see this information, so we've arranged our database such that information about your characters' feats and achievements
	are stored separately from the character names, and all of this data is stored separately from your account name/information.
	If for some reason you are paranoid about your character's information, you are encouraged to use fictitious character names
	and/or fictitious account names. As of Release 2.0.3, it is possible for you to mark a character as "Public", allowing it
	to be intentionally shared with anyone else. This feature is disabled by default.</small></p>
